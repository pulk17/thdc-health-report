## 1. Project Background and Objectives

### Background
THDC India Ltd. required an efficient solution for generating standardized health reports for employees and their families. Prior to this project, the health reporting process was largely manual, leading to inconsistencies in report formatting, difficulty in tracking patient history, and inefficient data management.

### Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly web application for medical staff to input patient data
- Implement a comprehensive system to record various health test results with reference values
- Create standardized Excel reports with consistent formatting
- Ensure data validation to minimize errors
- Design a solution that works efficiently in the existing IT infrastructure
- Make the application accessible via GitHub Pages for easy deployment

## 2. System Architecture

The application follows a client-side single-page application (SPA) architecture built with React and TypeScript. This architecture was chosen for its simplicity, ease of deployment, and ability to function without requiring server-side components.

### Key Architectural Components:
- Frontend UI built with React and Material-UI
- Client-side state management using React hooks
- Form validation using Material-UI validation patterns
- Excel report generation using ExcelJS library
- Routing with React Router (HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility)
- Deployment via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages

## 6. Implementation Details

### Component Structure
The application is structured into the following key components:
- **MainDataEntryPage**: The main container component
- **PersonalInfoForm**: Manages patient and OPD information
- **TestResultsSection**: Handles test result data entry
- **TestItemRow**: Individual test input component
- **ReportGeneration**: Controls report generation

### Data Model
- **PatientInfo**: Structure for patient data
- **DoctorDetails**: Structure for doctor information
- **HealthTestItem**: Base test item structure
- **ExtendedHealthTestItem**: Enhanced test structure with validation
- **PredefinedTest**: Template for test definitions with reference values

### Key Implementation Features

#### Comprehensive Test Data
The application includes a detailed set of predefined tests with:
- Complete Blood Count (CBC) with all standard parameters
- Kidney Function Tests (KFT)
- Liver Function Tests (LFT)
- Lipid Profile
- Glucose tests
- Each test includes appropriate units and reference ranges

#### Reference Value Management
- Gender-specific reference ranges for applicable tests
- Age-specific values where relevant (Adult vs. Children)
- Proper units for each test type

#### Form Validation
- Required field validation for all patient and doctor information
- Input validation for test results based on expected data type
- Error messaging for invalid inputs

#### Excel Report Generation
- Structured Excel workbook with consistent formatting
- Custom styling for headers, labels, and values
- Proper cell merging and border application
- Organized sections for different information categories

## 7. Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: UI Layout Issues with Material-UI Grid
**Problem**: The Grid component from Material-UI was causing layout issues and linter errors.
**Solution**: Replaced Grid components with Box components using flexbox properties, which provided more predictable and consistent layout behavior.

### Challenge 2: Gender-Specific Reference Values
**Problem**: Some tests require different reference ranges based on patient gender.
**Solution**: Implemented a dynamic reference value system that updates test reference ranges when gender selection changes.

### Challenge 3: Excel Report Formatting
**Problem**: Creating consistently formatted Excel reports with proper borders and styling.
**Solution**: Used the ExcelJS library with custom styling functions to apply consistent formatting to all cells.

### Challenge 4: GitHub Pages Routing
**Problem**: Client-side routing not working correctly when deployed to GitHub Pages.
**Solution**: Implemented HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter and added custom 404.html handling for proper SPA functionality.

### Challenge 5: Form Validation
**Problem**: Ensuring all required fields are filled before report generation.
**Solution**: Created a comprehensive validation system that checks all required fields and displays specific error messages for missing information.
